# Amazon-Product-Recommendation-System

Welcome to the project on Recommendation Systems. We will work with the Amazon product reviews dataset for this project. The dataset contains ratings of different electronic products. It does not include information about the products or reviews to avoid bias while building the model.

Context
E-commerce websites like Amazon, Flipkart uses different recommendation models to provide personalized suggestions to different users. For example, one of the recommendation models that Amazon uses is item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real-time.

Objective
Build a recommendation system to recommend products to customers based on their previous ratings for other products.
